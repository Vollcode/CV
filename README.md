Recruiter, mediator, psychologist, indiscriminate gamer and junior developer would be the first things that to come up to my mind when describing myself. With coding I have found the perfect way to blend  my passions. I look forward to meeting a team where I can grow while challenging me intellectually.

I am very eager to learn new technologies, I believe a person should never stagnate in any aspect of their life. Each new language or framework could easily be the next big thing, and I wish to know that technology inside and out when that happens.

## <a name="skills">How my colleagues describe me</a>

#### Curiosity

 Throughout my life I've discovered that the stuff I know is not only less than the stuff that I know I don't know, and much less than the the stuff that I don't know I don't know. However, knowing this puts me in a position of great hunger to acquire the proficiency I've yet to master.

#### Adaptability

 While working in banking, I had to go from office to office helping tally their numbers. Some offices received me warmly, others not so much, but they were all different and I had fun meeting so many people and helping them. And even though the experience wasn't always good, my reviews were.

#### Perseverance

No stone unturned when it comes to good work. When something is not clear, does not work properly, or could be built better, it means we can either learn more about it or make a superior version. When I worked as a mediator in a charity I dealt with people going through emotionally difficult situations, even though some of my colleagues dropped out, working in such high pressure environment taught me how keep going in challenging settings.

#### Understanding

 For several years I've helped a non government organization that aided people who needed therapy due to the massive impact the housing crisis had on them, but couldn't afford it or didn't had access to the public services. Hearing the experiences of so many people gives an understanding of the privileges one has and does not consider. Over the years that has developed into an acceptance of everyone's way of thinking and lifestyle, thus letting thoughts outside the box come into play.

## <a name="experience">Previous career experience</a>

**CaixaBank** (June 2015 to January 2016)    
*Accountant*  
Handle every transaction the clients needed during the day while selling all the financial products the bank offered. At the end of the day I had to tally the numbers of the whole office and make sure there were no differences in cash.

**Randstad** (March 2014 to March 2015)   
*HR Recruiter*
As a recruiter I had to establish contact with clients, determine their hiring needs and write a contract based on that, as well as monitor the Social Security to make sure the workers were covered. Once the conditions are set, several filters were ran to find the correct candidate. Among the filters included interviews, written and online tests and onsite trials.

**Psychologists without Borders** (November 2013 to July 2015)  
*Mediator and Psychologist*  
As a Psychologist I provided cognitive-behavioral therapy to the public who couldn't afford a private psychologist or make use of the public services. Within the organization there was a program to provide assistance as a mediator to groups of people who were participating in an experimental housing project.

**Manpower** (September 2013 to March 2014)   
*HR Recruiter*

**Retail** (September 2009 to March 2016)  
*Waiter*  
*Host*  
*Delivery man*  
During many years I've worked a plethora of jobs that have given me the patience, perseverance and understanding that help me daily. Even though they were not career defining, they have helped me greatly in achieving in realizing that I appreciate a more cognitive intensive type of job.
