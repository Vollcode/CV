Recruiter, mediator, psychologist, indiscriminate gamer and junior developer would be the first things that to come up to my mind when describing myself. With coding I have found the perfect way to blend  my passions. I look forward to meeting a team where I can grow while challenging me intellectually.

I am very eager to learn new technologies, I believe a person should never stagnate in any aspect of their life. Each new language or framework could easily be the next big thing, and I wish to know that technology inside and out when that happens.

## <a name="skills">Some virtues I've acquired</a>

#### Curiosity

 In Makers, every week we were introduced to new technologies, and sometimes not knowing all the functionalities of a new program makes that one annoying bug impossible to solve. Having the curiosity to search and tweak around has helped me greatly in fixing the small daily problems that we encounter in our code.  

 In my previous roles I've discovered that the stuff I know is not only less than the stuff that I know I don't know, and much less than the the stuff that I don't know I don't know. However, knowing this puts me in a position of great hunger to acquire the proficiencies I've yet to master, and thanks to Makers I got all the tools I needed to feed that hunger.

#### Adaptability

 As a Maker, we had to work with a different person every single day, and learning quickly your pair's code and their pace is essential to a good programming day. Being quick to adapt to a new person has made every day a good working experience.

 While working in banking, I had to go from office to office helping tally their numbers. Some offices received me warmly, others not so much, but they were all different and I had fun meeting so many people and helping them. And even though the experience wasn't always good, my reviews were.

#### Perseverance

Sometimes the answer is right around the corner, sometimes we need a rest to avoid tunnel vision. In Makers, I've been taught when to keep pushing for answers when I believe it is possible to achieve it, and to take a rest when smoke is coming out of our ears and we're reaching nowhere.

In some of my previous roles I applied a "No stone unturned" policy when it came to good work. If something wasn't clear, didn't work properly, or could be built better, it meant we could either learn more about it or make a superior version. When I worked as a mediator in a charity I dealt with people going through emotionally difficult situations, even though some of my colleagues dropped out, I managed to make sure the program finished on good terms and about 60% of the patients managed to get housing.

#### Understanding

 Trying to convey your thought in an easy way to make your pair partner understand what you think of a problem is quite difficult. In Makers you have to learn how every other person in the team thinks to understand what they're trying to convey.

 For several years I've helped a non government organization that aided people who needed therapy due to the massive impact the housing crisis had on them, but couldn't afford it or didn't had access to the public services. Hearing the experiences of so many people gives an understanding of the privileges one has and does not consider. Over the years that has developed into an acceptance of everyone's way of thinking and lifestyle, thus letting thoughts outside the box come into play.

## <a name="projects">What I've done so far</a>

## <a name="experience">Previous career experience</a>

**CaixaBank** (June 2015 to January 2016)    
*Accountant*  
Handle every transaction the clients needed during the day while selling all the financial products the bank offered. At the end of the day I had to tally the numbers of the whole office and make sure there were no differences in cash.

**Randstad** (March 2014 to March 2015)   
*HR Recruiter*
As a recruiter I had to establish contact with clients, determine their hiring needs and write a contract based on that, as well as monitor the Social Security to make sure the workers were covered. Once the conditions are set, several filters were ran to find the correct candidate. Among the filters included interviews, written and online tests and onsite trials.

**Psychologists without Borders** (November 2013 to July 2015)  
*Mediator and Psychologist*  
As a Psychologist I provided cognitive-behavioral therapy to the public who couldn't afford a private psychologist or make use of the public services. Within the organization there was a program to provide assistance as a mediator to groups of people who were participating in an experimental housing project.

**Manpower** (September 2013 to March 2014)   
*HR Recruiter*  
Filtering CV's and interviewing candidates for the required positions, as well as writing contracts based on the clients needs and monitoring the Social Security movements to assure the well-being of the workers.

**Retail** (September 2009 to March 2016)  
*Waiter*  
*Host*  
*Delivery man*  
During many years I've worked a plethora of jobs that have given me the patience, perseverance and understanding that help me daily. Even though they were not career defining, they have helped me greatly in achieving in realizing that I appreciate a more cognitive intensive type of job.
