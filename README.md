Indiscriminate gamer, software developer, mediator and psychologist would be the words that come to my head when I describe myself. Throughout my life I've searched for situations where I could learn by putting myself out there, usually by volunteering in exciting endeavours. I look forward to meeting a team where I can grow while challenging myself intellectually.

Every new technology could easily be the next big thing. I want to know them inside out before that happens. I am very eager to work with new tools and I believe a person should never stagnate in any aspect of their life. Thus I've decided to reinvent myself through a career in software development, where I can acquire new proficiencies every single day while creating amazing programs.

## <a name="skills">Some virtues I've acquired</a>

#### Curiosity

 Every week in Makers we were introduced to new technologies. Often not knowing all the functionalities of a new program made that one annoying bug impossible to solve. Having the curiosity to search and dig deeper has helped me immensely in fixing the small daily problems that we encounter in our code.  

 In my previous roles I've discovered that the stuff I know is not only less than the stuff that I know I don't know, and much less than the the stuff that I don't know I don't know. However, knowing this puts me in a position of great hunger to acquire the proficiencies I've yet to master, and thanks to Makers I have all the tools I needed to feed that hunger.

#### Adaptability and Teamwork

 As a Maker, every single day we had to work either with a different person or in a group, and learning quickly the pace of your group and their coding style is essential to a good programming day. Being quick to adapt to a new situation has made every day a good working experience.

 While working as an accountant, I had to go from office to office helping tally their numbers. Some offices received me warmly, others not so much, but they were all different and I had fun meeting so many people and learning how to work together while helping them. And even though the experience wasn't always good, my reviews were.

#### Perseverance

Sometimes the answer is right around the corner, sometimes we need a rest to avoid tunnel vision. In Makers, I've been taught when to keep pushing for answers when I believe it is possible to achieve it, and to take a rest when smoke is coming out of our ears and we're reaching nowhere.

In some of my previous roles I applied a "No stone unturned" policy when it came to good work. If something wasn't clear, didn't work properly, or could be built better, it meant we could either learn more about it or make a superior version. When I worked as a mediator in a charity I dealt with people going through very emotionally difficult situations. Even though some of my colleagues dropped out, I managed to make sure the program finished on good terms and about 60% of the patients managed to get housing.

#### Communication

 Trying to convey your thoughts in a way that your pair partner understands how and what you think of a problem is quite difficult. In Makers you have to learn how every other person in the team thinks to understand what they're trying to convey.

 For several years I've provided therapy in a non government organization that aided people affected by the massive impact the housing crisis, but couldn't afford it or didn't had access to the public services. Hearing the experiences of so many people gives an understanding of the privileges one has and does not consider. Over the years that has developed into an acceptance of everyone's way of thinking and lifestyle, thus letting thoughts outside the box come into play.

## <a name="experience">Previous career experience</a>

**CaixaBank** (July 2015 to December 2015)    
*Accountant*  
Handle every transaction the clients needed during the day while selling all the financial products the bank offered. At the end of the day I had to tally the numbers of the whole office and make sure there were no differences in cash.

**Randstad** (March 2014 to March 2015)   
*HR Recruiter*  
As a recruiter I had to establish contact with clients, determine their hiring needs and write a contract based on that, as well as monitor the Social Security to make sure the workers were covered. Once the conditions are set, several filters were ran to find the correct candidate. Among the filters included interviews, written and online tests and onsite trials.

**Psychologists without Borders** (November 2013 to July 2015)  
*Mediator and Psychologist*  
As a Psychologist I provided cognitive-behavioral therapy to the public who couldn't afford a private psychologist or make use of the public services. Within the organization there was a program to provide assistance as a mediator to groups of people who were participating in an experimental housing project.

**Manpower** (September 2013 to February 2014)   
*HR Recruiter*  
Filtering CV's and interviewing candidates for the required positions, as well as writing contracts based on the clients needs and monitoring the Social Security movements to assure the well-being of the workers.

**Retail** (September 2009 to March 2016)  
*Waiter*  
*Host*  
*Delivery man*  
During many years I've worked a plethora of jobs that have given me the patience, perseverance and understanding that help me daily. Even though they were not career defining, they have helped me greatly in achieving in realizing that I appreciate a more cognitive intensive type of job.
